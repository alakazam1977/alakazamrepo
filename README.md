This code is built to generate a robot follower line. The robot can move along the black line whether sharp turn or bend line.
Black line readings must be 600 and above.
The hardware required is an Arduino Mega 2560 R3 microcomputer (ori), 2Amp motor drive shield, IR obstacle sensor module, LSS05 line sensor, custom chassis and others.

Enjoy!!!
